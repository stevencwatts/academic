In this talk, I look at contemporary horror novels about meat processessing--Agustina Bazterrica's _Tender is the Flesh__ and Elle Nash's _Deliver Me_. Both novels document the logistics of growing, processessing, and delivering factory farmed meat to deindustrializing societies. In _Deliver Me_, the meat is chicken and in _Tender is the Flesh_, the meat is human. Bazterrica's novel normalizes lab-grown cannibalism while Nash's novel about chicken production horrifies, and I argue that this contrast illustrates the naturalization of unsustainable meat processing practices that spread illness, exacerbate climate change, and cause untold harm to workers, consumers, and animals.
