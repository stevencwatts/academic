This paper looks at the movement opposing the construction of "Cop City" in Atlanta as an example of discourse attempting to represent the metabolic rift. In it, I explore how the various movement strategies compose their arguments and how the arguments are aimed at representing the rift. The, I turn to Joy Williams' 2021 novel _Harrow_ to demonstrate what parallel discourse looks like in fiction. Using strategies like genre-flail and invoking speculative fiction, _Harrow_ explores life from the present into a Kafkaesque future where even the admiration of nature necessitates legal action. By comparing the real life rhetorical strategies of movement activists in Atlanta to contemporary literary strategies, this paper builds a case for how to unify representation of the metabolic rift across venues.
