In this paper, I look at Olga Tokarczuk's Environmental Murder Mystery, _Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead_ to describe how land rights have contributed to the widening of the metabolic rift and a worsening of climate crises. Poaching plays a central role, first in a secret society of wealthy poachers illegally hunting animals and then through the ostensibly supernatural revenge of the animals on the society. Tokarczuk places the novel on the border of Czechia and Poland, a border that has changed dramatically throughout recent history. In staging the novel on this border and describing what constitutes poaching in which locale, who is safe from poaching and who is in danger, and the seasonal rotations of poaching, _Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead_ presents a clear object through which to understand how the fetishization of land facilitates the total extraction of resources at a scale incompatible with capitalist production.
