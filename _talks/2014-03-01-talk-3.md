This paper explores "growth" as an expected characteristic of fictional protagonists alongside "growth" as an expected outcome of contemporary economic policy and argues for the cooption of personal growth under economic policy while advocating for the unsustainability of both. This project looks at the role that degrowth places in environmentalist movements and compares that advocacy to reviewer complaints about the lack of protagonist growth in novels about ecoterrorism. The lack of growth on both accounts, I argue, is a rhetorical strategy to decenter GDP from conversations about what makes an ethical, successful, and pleasant life.
