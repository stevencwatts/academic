excerpt: "This article argues for the importance of infrastructure as the object for contemporary suspicion. A hermeneutics of suspicion has been increasingly argued against for decades by literary scholars, and this article argues that Lydia Millet's fiction presents a case study in how to level suspicion and at what objects suspicion should be levelled productively in a contemporary, deindustrializing economy. This article uses scholars of environmental humanities in looking at the state of deindustrial economies and the need for suspicion."
