excerpt: "This article uses histories of the novel, particularly Ian Watts' Rise of the Novel, to historicize contemporary developments in video game production. I argue that the FromSoftware game Elden Ring represents a moment where the form and content of video games fully allegorize their moment of production in the way that Middlemarch is seen as epitomizing the height of novelistic allegories of industrial production."
