excerpt: 'This article explores literary methods of representing the divergence of productive and geological scales analyzed by Marx and contributing to the climate crisis. It examines Nell Zink's 2014 indie hit _The Wallcreeper_ to argue that there is a growing genre of novels that feature a kind of genre flail that pits domestic reproduction alongside ecological terrorism to help illustrate these competing scales, to illustrate the relationship between the two, and to argue for a dramatic realignment of the productive scales to ease pressure on geological scales and mitigate climate catastrophe.'
