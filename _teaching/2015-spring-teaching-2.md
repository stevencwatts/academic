Open for course titles, descriptions, and syllabi of previous institutions.

Before my current job at Mount Marty University, I had 10 years of experience being the instructor of record across six institutions and several position titles. In all positions, my pedagogy emphasizes environmental humanities as a space for active engagement with and inquiry into the world along with student’s own lives and learning styles. This active engagement starts by helping students understand the classroom as a space of social infrastructure—a shared space that facilitates social interactions for the purposes of learning through inquiry. In service of that purpose, my classes emphasize collaborative activities and reflection on how students understand the application of course material to their goals. As part of this focus on community building and active learning, I ask students to consider how rhetoric—whether expressed through composition, literature, or film—acts in the world, and I emphasize how humanities courses remain one of the university environments best suited for reflection on challenging material in order to understand these rhetorical acts. I have taught writing, literature, film, and area studies courses. Clink on the links below to download sample syllabi.

Herbert Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Tennessee-Knoxville (2023-2024)
In this position I taught first year writing and public writing classes. My first year writing classes were themed around writing as a mode of inquiry for local history and ecology. My public writing classes were themed around the genre of multimodal manifesto. Students in these classes engaged with genre, modality, and rhetorical knowledge to compose long form writing projects.

Visiting Assistant Professor, Oxford College of Emory University (2021-2023)
In this position, I taught first year writing and contemporary literature courses at Emory's liberal arts campus. I worked with small classes to imagine how writing and reading were ways of engaging with the students' world. In these classes, we looked at local ecology, toured and wrote about Oxford's organic farm, and read literature representing the ecology of the south in general and Georgia specifically.
