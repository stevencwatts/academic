Open for list of courses, descriptions, and syllabi. 

Gen 102: This is an introduction to university course for incoming freshmen. The course helps students understand the infrastructures that facilitate university life and provide them with the schematics for navigating those infrastructures. 

English 103: The Essay. This course emphasizes the foundational components of the writing process: creation, drafting, revision, and editing. Using visual art as the object of study, students write a descriptive essay, narrative essay, and expository essay based on visual art of their choice while engaging in these foundational components. This course uses open-access texts.

English 104: Critical Writing. This course introduces the core components of academic writing: namely, research. I use visual art as the object of study in this course as well, and we read critics like T.J. Clark and Michael Fried on art before engaging in a scaffolded research process starting with Google searches before proceding to a source worksheet, an annotated bibliography, and finally, a research essay. This course uses open-access texts.

English 210: Introduction to Literature. This is a general education course that introduces the study of literature to non-majors. In this class, we look at recent award-winning stories, poems, plays, and novels in an attempt to understand why culture still cares about literature in a multimodal, hyperlinked attention-economy. Along with the literary texts, we read work by scholars like Dan Sinykin, Sarah Brouillette, Richard Jean So, and Juliana Spahr to examine the social, cultural, and economic study of literature.

English 220: The Short Story. This is a general education course that introduces close-reading practices to non-majors. In this course, we study what close-reading is, how to do it, and how close-reading short stories is a useful critical and cognitive skill across the disciplines. We begin by looking at basic fictional characteristics like plot, narrator, setting, and character. From there, students are introduced to different methods of close reading like historiography, structuralism, and Marxism. The last unit of the class is centered around reading for social problems and asks students to apply their knowledge of characteristics and methodologies together to understand the social concerns represented across a variety of short stories. 

English 286T: Contemporary Literature & The Environment. In this course, we work to understand both the formal conventions of contemporary novels, poetry, and film while thinking through core representative concepts questioned by ongoing climate catastrophe. Primarily, we explore different artistic methods of representing temporal and geological scale and map those on to the problems of representing the geological and geographical scale of climate change. Students produce close reading, research papers, and maps annotated with information about climate and representation of the relevant locales.

English 286T: American Indian Literature. This course examines how literature can be a form of cultural knowledge and identity exploration. We look at literature produced by Great Plains Nations like the Lakota, Dakota, and Oglala nations to see how what was once hegemonic cultural knowledge has maintained throughout history, been pressured by competing hegemonic knowledge, and preserved and created new epistemologies, methodologies, and artistic identities for the Great Plains Nations. This is an interdisciplinary class that incorporates Native American Studies, history, geography, and political science into literary discourse. Students produce histories, literary analyses, and empistemological maps.

English 344: Recent British Literature. This is a general education course that introduces majors and non-majors to Anglophone writers from 1780-Present. In this class, we trace the textual development and decline of the nation-state over this period, starting with neo-classical poets and continuing on to the contemporary post-fictional Anglophone authors. 

English 356: The Novel. In this class we focused on the novel as a communicative technology that represents a specific social world and mode of production. The semester started by reading _The Tale of Genji_ and proceded through the years and across continents to explore how the methods of representation respond to changes in social reproduction. Students collectively wrote a _Theories of the Novel_ glossary using texts from class as objects of study.

English 399: Senior Seminar. This is a collaboratively lead course with other professors in the department. In this course, we arrange for graduating seniors to conduct a semester long research-project that culminates in an article-length paper and a public presentation.
