English 103: The Essay. This course emphasizes the foundational components of the writing process: creation, drafting, revision, and editing. Using visual art as the object of study, students write a descriptive essay, narrative essay, and expository essay based on visual art of their choice while engaging in these foundational components. This course uses open-access texts.

English 104: Critical Writing. This course introduces the core components of academic writing: namely, research. I use visual art as the object of study in this course as well, and we read critics like T.J. Clark and Michael Fried on art before engaging in a scaffolded research process starting with Google searches before proceding to a source worksheet, an annotated bibliography, and finally, a research essay. This course uses open-access texts.

English 210: Introduction to Literature. This is a general education course that introduces the study of literature to non-majors. In this class, we look at recent award-winning stories, poems, plays, and novels in an attempt to understand why culture still cares about literature in a multimodal, hyperlinked attention-economy. Along with the literary texts, we read work by scholars like Dan Sinykin, Sarah Brouillette, Richard Jean So, and Juliana Spahr to examine the social, cultural, and economic study of literature.

English 220: The Short Story. This is a general education course that introduces close-reading practices to non-majors. In this course, we study what close-reading is, how to do it, and how close-reading short stories is a useful critical and cognitive skill across the disciplines. We begin by looking at basic fictional characteristics like plot, narrator, setting, and character. From there, students are introduced to different methods of close reading like historiography, structuralism, and Marxism. The last unit of the class is centered around reading for social problems and asks students to apply their knowledge of characteristics and methodologies together to understand the social concerns represented across a variety of short stories.
